CSV and Template Comparing: Libraries?
	http://code.google.com/p/jcsv/
	http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/
	If the javax.xml doesn't work, then http://xstream.codehaus.org/

Template Comparing: Throw to XML, compare columns that way? If equal, then using that template is valid. (y/n?)

Question: What are the usual charts you make for this purpose?
Question: How do you obtain the data?

Drawings of prototype application made. Program flow chart, idea of window, etc.

Tentative flow: Select file(s), convert CSV file to XML, clean up XML, obtain template or create a template via column selection, graph image, give option to save as PNG or JPEG, give option to save template, return to start; end.
