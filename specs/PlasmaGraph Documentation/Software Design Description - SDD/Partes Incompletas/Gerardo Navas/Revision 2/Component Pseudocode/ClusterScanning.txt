DataSet scan (HeaderData, Template, GraphPair):
	Obtain the DataSet object from the HeaderData and GraphPair objects.

	If the Template object's Outlier Distance Type is equal to the Mahalanobis setting:
		Create a new MahalanobisDistance object.
	Otherwise:
		Create a new CartesianDistance object whose distance is equal to the Template object's Outlier Distance value.

	Obtain a List of clustered data points via the DBSCANClusterer object.

	If the Template object's Outlier Response is to warn the user:
		Show a window describing which points are considered outliers based on the Template object's Outlier Distance Type.

	Ask the user if they wish to remove the outlier points.
	If the user affirms:
		Return a DataSet containing the largest cluster of points provided by the DBSCANClusterer object.
