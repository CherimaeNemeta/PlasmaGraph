boolean getHeaders (HeaderData):
	If the file hasn't been read yet:
		Read the data file's contents
		Store its contents within this MatlabProcessor object's HashMap

	For each MLArray object in the HashMap:
		If the MLArray is empty or only contains null or NaN values:
			Remove that MLArray from the HashMap

	If the HashMap contains two or more MLArrays:
		If each MLArray in the HashMap contains the same number of rows:

			For each MLArray in the HashMap:
				Create a new HeaderColumn object containing the MLArray's name and data type
				Add the HeaderColumn object to the HeaderData object

			Set the HeaderData object's file to that used in this MatlabProcessor object

			Return true

		Otherwise:
			Open an error window explaining that the data file contained MLArrays with different numbers of rows

	Otherwise:
		Open an error window explaining that the data file contained less than two graphable columns and cannot be used

void toDataSet (DataSet, GraphPair, HeaderData):
	If the file hasn't been read yet:
		Read the data file's contents
		Store its contents within this MatlabProcessor object's HashMap

	Create a list object

	For each MLArray in this MatlabProcessor object's HashMap:
		If the MLArray's name is the same as that of a column in the GraphPair object:
			Add that MLArray to the list object

	For each row in the MLArrays in the list:
		If the row only contains valid values:
			Add that row's X Column MLArray value to the DataSet object's X Column
			Add that row's Y Column MLArray value to the DataSet object's Y Column
			If the GraphPair contains a Group column:
				Add that row's Group Column MLArray value to the DataSet object's Group Column
