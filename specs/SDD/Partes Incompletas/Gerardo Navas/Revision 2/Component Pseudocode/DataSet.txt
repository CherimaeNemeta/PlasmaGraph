XYSeries toXYGraphDataset (GraphPair):
	Create a new XYSeries object with the name provided by the GraphPair object
	For each row in this DataSet object:
		Add the row's X and Y values into the XYSeries object
	Return the XYSeries object

XYSeriesCollection toGroupedXYGraphDataset (GraphPair):
	Create a HashMap object containing Object and XYSeries objects
	For each row in this DataSet object:
		If the HashMap object contains a value equal to the Group Column's value in the row:
			Add the row's X and Y values into that XYSeries object
		Otherwise:
			Create a new XYSeries object with that Group Column value
			Add the row's X and Y values into that XYSeries object
			Add that Group Column value and XYSeries object into the HashMap
	Create a new XYSeriesCollection object
	For each XYSeries object in the HashMap:
		Add the XYSeries object into the XYSeriesCollection object

	Return the XYSeriesCollection object
