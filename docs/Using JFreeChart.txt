Things to do in order to make a chart in JFreeChart:

1) Create a new JFreeChart called "chart" with a specific <ChartType>Dataset. (For example, Pie Charts use the PieDataset type to designate their data.)
	a) Consider having two methods: One to generate a new <ChartType>Dataset and another to generate a new JFreeChart with that <ChartType>Dataset.
		That is, a "private static <ChartType>Dataset createDataset () {...}" and a "private static JFreeChart createChart (<ChartType>Dataset set) {...}".

2) Within "createChart (...)", create a new JFreeChart via "ChartFactor.create<DataType>Chart (...)". The parameters for said chart vary. (For createPieChart, they are (Name, Dataset, Legend?, ToolTips?, Generate URLs?).) You can then return that chart.
	a) Within createChart, we can pass all the template settings as a Template type. With that, we can make changes to the object via Branch 1's method.

3) Have the creator of the JPanel return a "new ChartPanel (chart)". The constructor of the Chart can then use that ChartPanel to set the Content Pane (via setContentPane(...)) to the correct image.

4) Call pack()  and setVisible (true) on the JFrame holding the chart.

Branch 1: Editing the Graph.

1) Create a new <ChartType>Plot called "plot" by casting "chart.getPlot ()" to "<ChartType>Plot".

2) By calling the variable "plot", you can set a number of <ChartType>Plot settings.
