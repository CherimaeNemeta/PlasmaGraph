# PlasmaGraph

## What?
PlasmaGraph is a Matlab Level-5 data-graphing program being developed by PVG, a Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico programming group, for a Senior Project for the university's Plasma Laboratory!

## Progress?

Program's at its first viable version. Various things are slated to be done once the project's done.

## Who?

We are:
  * Gerardo A. Navas: Computer Science Student @ Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.
  * Daniel Quintini: Computer Science Student @ Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.

We're both senior students in PUPR that are working on our Capstone project. Working with science / engineering people is pretty great, so we decided to take a project that would allow us to deal with data and working with it.
