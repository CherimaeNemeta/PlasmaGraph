## Who Are We

  We are:
    * Gerardo A. Navas: Computer Science Student @ Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.
    * Daniel Quintini: Computer Science Student @ Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.

  We're both senior students in PUPR that are working on our Capstone project. Working with science / engineering people is pretty great, so we decided to take a project that would allow us to deal with data and working with it.
